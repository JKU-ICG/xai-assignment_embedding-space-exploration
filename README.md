# Explainable AI - Exploration of Projection Spaces
In this task you are challenged to analyze and compare solutions of a problem, game, algorithm, model or anything else that can be represented by sequential states.
For this, you will project the data, link the states, and add meta-data to the visualization.
Details on the individual tasks can be found in the notebook.

## Development Environment

Checkout this repo and change into the folder
```
git clone <URL>
cd xai_explore_projected_space
```

Load the conda environment from the shared `environment.yml` file:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate xai_explore_projected_space
```

> Hint: For more information on Anaconda and enviroments take a look at the README form our [tutorial repository](https://github.com/JKU-ICG/python-visualization-tutorial).

Then launch Jupyter Lab:
```
jupyter lab
```

Go to http://localhost:8888/ and open the *template* notebook.

Alternatively, you can also work with [binder](https://mybinder.org/).

## Submission

* Make sure that you pushed your GitHub repository and not just committed it locally.
* Sending us an email with the code is not necessary.
* Please update the *environment.yml* file if you need additional libraries, otherwise the code is not executeable.
* Save your final executed notebook(s) as html (File > Download as > HTML) and add them to your repository.
